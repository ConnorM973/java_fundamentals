Without running the code below, please tell me what will print. Why?

"Parent called" will print on the first line and "Child called" will print on the second. When the child object is created, the constructor of the parent class is called first to make sure that
the object created is has all of its correct parameters (in this case none). It then moves down to the subclass Child method and prints the "Child called".


public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public Parent()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public Child()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
