Without running the code below, please tell me what it will print.

This will print "Child called" as the object instantiated is a child, and the doSomething() method in the child class is called, which implicitly overrides the
method of the same name in the parent class.

public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
    c.doSomething();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public void doSomething()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public void doSomething()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
